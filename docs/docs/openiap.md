Expo IAP conforms to the **[OpenIAP specification](https://openiap.dev)** — an open, vendor-neutral interoperability standard for in-app purchases across all platforms and frameworks.

## What is OpenIAP?

OpenIAP is not just a library — it's a **shared specification layer** that ensures consistent, secure, and verifiable in-app purchase behavior everywhere. Instead of each framework reinventing its own types, error models, and verification flows, OpenIAP defines them once in a single GraphQL schema and generates type-safe bindings for every platform.

## How It Works

```
GraphQL Schema (Single Source of Truth)
        │
        ▼
   IR (Intermediate Representation)
        │
        ├── Swift bindings    → openiap-apple (StoreKit 2)
        ├── Kotlin bindings   → openiap-google (Play Billing 8.x)
        ├── Dart bindings     → flutter_inapp_purchase
        └── GDScript bindings → godot-iap
```
